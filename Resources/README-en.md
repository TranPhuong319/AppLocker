# üîê AppLocker ‚Äì macOS Application Locker

**AppLocker** is a macOS security tool that lets you lock any application with a disguise mechanism and require user authentication before access.  

This project includes:

- `AppLocker.app`: The main menu bar application that manages locked apps.  
- `AppLockerHelper`: A privileged helper tool (runs as `root`) that handles access control.  
- `com.TranPhuong319.AppLockerHelper.plist`: A LaunchDaemon to start the helper at boot.
